Comparaison between General Relativity and Entangled Relativity for the study of cosmology.

Hi,

Just a code about the study of dark energy and matter era in Entengled Relativity.
In this theory we change the coupling between matter density and the curvature of space-time, from an additionnal one (in General Relativity) to a multiplicative one.
We use scalar tensor theory to obtain our set of equations.
Since we don't know the form of the matter lagrangian density for radiation era, we will stop before reaching it.

For the code:
First we solve the set of equation (solving the Klein-Gordon equation) in ER.
Second we do the same in GR.
And finally we can compare both theories.
